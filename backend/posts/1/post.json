{"title":"I just downvoted your comment.","time":1653719902744,"poster":"anon","content":"I just downvoted your comment.\n\nFAQ\nWhat does this mean?\nThe amount of karma (points) on your comment and Reddit account has decreased by one.\n\nWhy did you do this?\nThere are several reasons I may deem a comment to be unworthy of positive or neutral karma. These include, but are not limited to:\n\nRudeness towards other Redditors,\n\nSpreading incorrect information,\n\nSarcasm not correctly flagged with a /s.\n\nAm I banned from the Reddit?\nNo - not yet. But you should refrain from making comments like this in the future. Otherwise I will be forced to issue an additional downvote, which may put your commenting and posting privileges in jeopardy.\n\nI don't believe my comment deserved a downvote. Can you un-downvote it?\nSure, mistakes happen. But only in exceedingly rare circumstances will I undo a downvote. If you would like to issue an appeal, shoot me a private message explaining what I got wrong. I tend to respond to Reddit PMs within several minutes. Do note, however, that over 99.9% of downvote appeals are rejected, and yours is likely no exception.\n\nHow can I prevent this from happening in the future?\nAccept the downvote and move on. But learn from this mistake: your behavior will not be tolerated on Reddit.com. I will continue to issue downvotes until you improve your conduct. Remember: Reddit is privilege, not a right.","id":1,"replies":[]}
